1. created a simple spring boot web application using spring intializer website.
2. using postgres as a datasource hence creating a db to provide as spring datasource. For now
   only one db is created in the name of the tenant.
    //TODO In a larger picture we need to serve the api for multiple clients.
    // TODO Need to discuss with Sebin on how to design services that can serve multiple clients.

    The following is the command is spawn a docker container with container name postgresdb
    that runs postgres server with user postgres and password admin

    docker container run --name postgresdb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
    use the command to check the running containers
    docker container ls

3. create a sql script that creates a database and a user for the database.
4. copy the script to the docker container
   docker cp sqlscripts/forecaster.sql postgresdb:/
5. enter into the docker container bash
   docker container exec -it postgresdb bash
6. run the following command to execute the copied sql
   psql -U postgres --file forecaster.sql
7. Spring offers multiple ways to configure datasource beans. one way is to set in the application.properties
   another way is using java config beans.
   // TODO Need to discuss with sebin how they configure multiple datasources in their company and in general.
   for now going with application.properties
8. set the following properties in application.properties.(Remember that properties file doesn't allow spaces)
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/walmartdb
   spring.datasource.username=walmart
   spring.datasource.password=walmart@123
